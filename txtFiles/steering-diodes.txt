                                      STEERING DIODES

Electronic equipment that can operate on either AC power or battery power (like a laptop) or that
have a backup battery in case of power failure (like an alarm clock), need to have a way of
switching from one power source to the other.

This can be done very simply with steering diodes

                    DC
        110       power
        VAC                  12V                     D2               equipment
                  supply




                                                9V
The key here is that the 9V battery voltage is less than the 12V DC power supply voltage.

While the DC power supply is on, D1 has +12 volts on its anode, and is forward biased, powering
the equipment. Since there is about 0.7 volts across the diode, there is about +11.3 volts on the
cathode of D2, so it's reversed biased and doesn't conduct, isolating the battery.

However, if the DC power supply fails or is turned off, then diode D1 will become reversed
biased, and diode D2 will conduct current from the battery to power the equipment.


                               DIODE CIRCUIT PROTECTION

Diodes are widely used to protect circuits from being damaged by the high voltages produced by
electrostatic discharges or the rapid turn-off of current through inductors.

The diode arrangement above is used on the inputs of many integrated circuits as the tiny
transistors in integrated circuits are very susceptible to being damaged by electrostatic voltage
spikes that can occur when the circuit is being handled.
