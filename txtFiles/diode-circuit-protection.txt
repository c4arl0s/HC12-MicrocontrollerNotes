                               DIODE CIRCUIT PROTECTION

Diodes are widely used to protect circuits from being damaged by the high voltages produced by
electrostatic discharges or the rapid turn-off of current through inductors.

The diode arrangement above is used on the inputs of many integrated circuits as the tiny
transistors in integrated circuits are very susceptible to being damaged by electrostatic voltage
spikes that can occur when the circuit is being handled.
